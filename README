CGI/Application/GDGraph/lines_ap version 0.01
==========================================

This is pre-beta ALPHA release.

This module is written with a view to its use in the area of performance and availablity management of small to large computer
systems where data such as CPU, disk, swap usage are more easily interpreted when plotted as graphical images. This need
not be the only application of this module as any numeric 'tabular' data may be plotted using this method.

The kind of data retrieved from systems such as hard drive, CPU, memory utilisation 
etc lends itself well to dynamically generated line graphs.

Although it is easy to generate graphs 'on the fly' using GD and the Perl module GD::Graph, 
having a re-usable module that can be customised and rapidly deployed throughout a web 
infrastucture can cut out a lot of 'cutting and pasting'. 

The combination of CGI::Application, CGI::Session and GD::Graph into this 'wrapper' 
module 'GDGraph::Lines' seeks to make this goal more attainable.

An on line graph together with an HTML page in which to render it that is itself 'template driven' should be easy to
set up within the framework that this module has to offer. Session state data is maintained by CGI::Session so there is 
little need to transfer complex 'CGI parameter based' data between the outer web application and this module. Thus
data transfer is simplified and more private.

CGI::Application::GDGraph::lines is an answer to the book 'Writing Perl Modules for CPAN 
- Tregar's suggestion to use CGI::Application to build re-usable web applications.
